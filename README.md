# YouTube Radio

![Alt text](https://projects.dontdalon.com/assets/img/radio-screen.png)<br>

A simple Javascript web-app that contains a list of YouTube livestreams, offering a UI to switch between these streams.
Written using [Sprint](https://github.com/StormTersteeg/PHP-Sprint-Framework).

Available on the [web](https://radio.dontdalon.com/) and also as an executable (see releases).

### Known issues
- May or may not act "funky" on Firefox for unknown reasons.
- Channels stop working because their stream url changes (because they restart their stream etc).
